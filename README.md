# Manga Panel Separator

This is a part of data preprocessing I needed for my Machine Learning project **"Color Your Manga"** . I needed to seperate manga panels and use them as input data
in my model. The actual preprocessor was customized to use in my project. So, here is the core part only. Hope it saves some time if someone wants to do similar
kind of data preprocessing.
